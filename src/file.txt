**PART 1:**

- Make a request to this URL that returns a JSON - https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/VuFwckCdhVhoLJJ08/items?clean=true&format=json
- You get back an array of objects in the following shape (imagine there can be a million of those):

```json
[
{
"productId": "B07BQZ8S7V",
"offerId": "B092CB4GRR",
"price": "$4.25"
}
]
```

Each object contains data about a single offer with its unique `offerId`. `productId` might be the same for more offers â†’ One product can have one or multiple offers. 

- Process the data in a way that the new array will only contain the cheapest offer for each product. 


**PART 2:**

- Send the new array back to an Apify dataset (in the same format as we got it) following this workflow
- Create a new Dataset following this endpoint without the name parameter (https://docs.apify.com/api#/reference/datasets/dataset-collection/create-dataset)
- Push the new array to the created dataset following this endpoint (https://docs.apify.com/api#/reference/datasets/item-collection/put-items)

token to use = zp4YJam58EiymRe9uRSbJQGzg

- You can check if the data is being correctly updated using this endpoint (https://docs.apify.com/api#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items)
